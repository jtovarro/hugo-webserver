<time class=article-time--reading>5 minute read</time></div></footer></div></header><section class=article-content><h3 id=alba-gómez---technical-graduate>Alba Gómez - Technical Graduate</h3><p>Thank you for all the help and support during my first year at Red Hat. I really appreciate your confidence in me, giving me the opportunity to participe in real proyects to learn more about the day to day work.</p><p>Also, thank you for all the time you have spent teaching me new technologies, as well as getting me involved in calls with your team to meet more Red Hatters. I am sure you will achieve all your goals :)</p><h3 id=javier-león---consultant>Javier León - Consultant</h3><p>I think Juan Carlos has made a huge progress since he started as a junior consultant and, in my opinion, he is far above of what you can expect from a junior.</p><p>From a skills perspective, he has developed a huge knowledge about Ansible, Openshift, Satellite and RHEL, but he also knows where you can find help when you need it, which is the same or more important. I started to work with him as my shadowee and he was exactly what you expect from a shadowee, humble, keeping attention and always asking or noting question for later.</p><p>I have also worked with him in a gig where he was working alone and I helped them a little bit with Satellite. He knows how to talk and manage clients which is not easy at all. He noted the questions that he didn&rsquo;t know about and tried to help them in every area they needed, even when it wasn&rsquo;t his area of expertise and he needed to look for help. He is capable of carrying solo gigs without issues, an achievement to be proud of for someone who has been working in consulting for a year.</p><p>Besides, the best part of him is his attitude, you can tell from the first moment that he is eager to learn new things, he is always studying some certificate or new courses, reaching out to colleagues when he is in PD and trying to find out if there is anything interesting he can learn or help with.</p><p>To recap, he just have to continue working like he is doing right now, be a bit brave when facing new challenges and gain some experience because that is the only thing he lacks of.</p><h3 id=iván-aragones---senior-consultant>Iván Aragones - Senior Consultant</h3><p>Thanks for your great work automating the IPU processes. It&rsquo;s been a great base to be used in other similar projects. Awesome!</p><h3 id=fran-garcia---principal-consultant>Fran Garcia - Principal Consultant</h3><p>Juan Carlos has provided an excellent delivery in the AXA RHEL modernization project, first of a kind project done in the region. His guidance and patience towards a challenging project has driven it to success!</p><h3 id=adonis-garcia---consultant>Adonis Garcia - Consultant</h3><p>I just have good words to evaluate the work that Juan Carlos is doing in AXA. He just needed a few days of shadowing to take care of the project like he has been leading it from the beginning. I was so surprise how Juan Carlos learned new technologies in a short period of time and his capacity to gain customer’s trust.</p><p>He’s able to manage issues and challenges by himself even though he didn’t have expertise in some areas. That`s one of the best skills he can have as a consultant.</p><p>I’m pretty sure he’s gonna be soon one of our references in consulting. Nothing important to say as improvements, just keep pushing as until now and try to focus your carrer in what you want in order to be a referent person in some technologies/areas.</p><h3 id=ángel-ollè---specialist-solution-architect>Ángel Ollè - Specialist Solution Architect</h3><p>Having mentored in different cycles and opportunities here at the company, I can confidently say that Juan Carlos has demonstrated exceptional competencies and behaviors since joining us. Juan Carlos embodies the majority of the MULTIPLIER behaviors in a comprehensive manner, from connecting with others to collaborating effectively. Additionally, Juan Carlos has shown great influencing skills, being an attentive listener and exhibiting a strong commitment to the milestones presented in the pre-sales phase. Their perseverance is noteworthy, always looking out for the best interests of the team. Juan Carlos possesses excellent problem-solving abilities, customer interaction skills, and adds critical thinking to their repertoire, making them a strong candidate for any department. They are truly a person that any team would be fortunate to have on their roster.</p><p>Juan Carlos has demonstrated the ability to accompany us in client meetings and provide valuable feedback. They have also consistently fulfilled all the commitments that were set, including, in my opinion, something very important: taking the initiative to commit and deliver to the client, while maintaining high quality in their work. Juan Carlos has actively participated in internal team meetings, focusing on the team&rsquo;s goals and transferring their competence and ease to all members. When assigned tasks, he shown the capacity to resolve them and drive them forward. Juan Carlos has proven their ability to research and document, consistently going above and beyond by providing an extra mile of quality in their work.</p><p>He has greatly contributed to effective collaboration within the team, fostering a positive and productive work environment. He consistently seeks feedback and actively incorporates it into their work, displaying a growth mindset and a continuous desire to improve. He shown remarkable adaptability, quickly learning new technologies and processes, which has been invaluable in navigating complex projects and delivering exceptional results. Also, he&rsquo;s consistently demonstrate a high level of professionalism, displaying a positive and respectful attitude towards colleagues and clients alike.</p><p>He shown a genuine passion for their work, consistently demonstrating enthusiasm and dedication that inspires those around them.</p></section><footer class=article-footer></footer></article><div class=disqus-container></div><style>.disqus-container{background-color:var(--card-background);border-radius:var(--card-border-radius);box-shadow:var(--shadow-l1);padding:var(--card-padding)}</style><script>window.addEventListener("onColorSchemeChange",e=>{typeof DISQUS=="object"&&DISQUS.reset({reload:!0})})</script><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
